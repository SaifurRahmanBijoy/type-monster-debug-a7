                <h2 class="padding">1. Difference between Local storage and Session storage.</h2>
                <p class="padding-plus-font-size">Answer: The main difference between localStorage and sessionStorage is
                    that the localStorage stores
                    data with no expiration date, while the sessionStorage stores data from one session. Moreover,
                    localStorage is designed for storage that spans multiple windows, and it lasts beyond the current
                    session. On
                    the other hand, sessionStorage allows the user to carry out a single transaction but could be
                    carrying out multiple
                    transactions in different windows at the same time.

                <h2 class="padding">2. Difference between Global scope and Block scope.</h2>
                <p class="padding-plus-font-size">Answer: The variables defined outside of any function or curly
                    brackets are known as global variables and have global scope.
                    Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any function or
                    conditional state
                    can access that variable. Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be
                    defined as the scope of the variables inside the
                    curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional statements, or
                    something else. You are only
                    allowed to refer to these variables from within the curly brackets {}.

                <h2 class="padding">3. How does Javascript event loop works?</h2>
                <p class="padding-plus-font-size">Answer: The event loop is a process that waits for the Call Stack to
                    be clear before pushing callbacks from the Task Queue to
                    the Call Stack. Once the Stack is clear, the event loop triggers and checks the Task Queue for
                    available callbacks. If
                    there are any, it pushes it to the Call Stack, waits for the Call Stack to be clear again, and
                    repeats the same process.
